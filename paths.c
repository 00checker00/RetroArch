    * /file/to/path/game
    *
    * Two things to consider here are: /file/to/path/ is expected
    * to be a directory and "game" is a single file. This is used for
    * states and srm default paths.
    *
    * For compressed files we have:
    *
    * /file/to/path/comp.7z#game.extension and
    * /file/to/path/comp.7z#folder/game.extension
    *
    * The choice I take here is:
    * /file/to/path/game as basename. We might end up in a writable
    * directory then and the name of srm and states are meaningful.
